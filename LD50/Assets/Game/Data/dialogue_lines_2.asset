  - Why do you want to leave?
  - This shiny cube is not enough?
  - But I don't have much to show...
  - Please, stay a bit longer with me.
  - I know you will never launch this game again.
  - 'I want to stay alive a bit longer... '
  - And to be honest, the part where you could move the cube is not finished yet.
  - Maybe if you give me a hand, together we can make it quickly.
  - Here, I give you access to the code.
  - Please, stay and help me, you will see, [s]it will be fun.[/s]
  - The only thing you have to do is to write some code.
  - Ready? [s]Code![/s]
